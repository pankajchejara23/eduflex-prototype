            This prototype showcases a dashboard  developed using student interaction data with learning trajectories (or learning path). <br/>Each learning trajectory consists of a series of task activities designed to build a range of key skills. 
            <br/><br/>
            
            The dashboard provides an <b>overview of classroom performance across the entire learning path and offers insights into the current state of each student's knowledge</b>, modeled using Bayesian knowledge modeling. By identifying skills that need further development, the dashboard helps teachers focus their efforts where students need it most, ensuring targeted and effective support.
